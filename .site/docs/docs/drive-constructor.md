title: Drive Constructor

The JAR Template drive constructor can build drivetrains with no tracking wheels, but also supports tank and holonomic odometry, with either red optical encoders or V5 rotation sensors. Note that each constructor has the same prototype, and that every drive style **requires** a V5 inertial sensor.

:::caution
**Do not try to add extra motor groups, sensors, or values to the constructor or to remove any that you do not need. The code will not compile. Follow the style of the examples, only filling in fields that are already present.**
:::

:::note
For odometry users using red optical encoders: the top wire of the encoder is always plugged in one port above the bottom wire, and it is the top wire that is indicated in VexCode. So putting the port as "3" means that the encoder is plugged into triports C and D on the brain with the top wire in port C and the bottom wire in port D. Likewise, putting the port as "5" means the encoder is plugged into ports E and F.

## Drive Setup Examples

### No Tracking Wheels without Odometry

*Corresponds to ZERO_TRACKER_NO_ODOM*

Note that for this drive setup, nothing needs to be edited after the gyro scale factor.

### No Tracking Wheels with Odometry

*Corresponds to ZERO_TRACKER_ODOM*

For this drive setup, the only thing that needs to be edited after gyro scale factor is the Forward Tracker Center distance. Since this constructor uses the drive motor encoders to track position, Forward Tracker Center distance is just the distance from the center of your robot to the right set of wheels.

Typically, this odometry style is used when a tank drive has locked omni wheels. The tracking wheel must be parallel to the direction of travel, and therefore only the constants for the Forward Tracker must be edited from their original state. See the note above about optical encoder wiring.

### Two Red Optical Encoders on a Holonomic Drive

*Corresponds to HOLONOMIC_TWO_ENCODER* 

This setup only works with a four motor X-Drive or mecanum drive. These tracking wheels must be perpendicular to each other. The Forward Tracker is parallel to the direction of travel, and the Sideways Tracker is perpendicular to the direction of travel. See the note above about optical encoder wiring.

## On Gyro Scale

### Intuition

The gyro scale parameter is often the least intuitive parameter in the drive constructor, but it serves a particularly important purpose.

You may have noticed that V5 IMU sensors often display a bit of error. For example, even if you spin the robot around by a perfect 360 degrees, the sensor's output may say 358.5 every single time. Try it yourself. On most vex gyroscopes, you will get a consistent one or two degrees of error per rotation every time. This adds up, so a robot that reads 359 degrees after one spin will read 350 degrees after ten spins.

One solution is to keep trying new gyros until you find one that's as close to perfect as possible, and this is a lot of teams' go-to method. But I propose a new one. Just multiply the gyro's output by a small scale factor to make the robots rotation equal to 360 degrees every single time. This will negate the effect of the gyro's error and make your runs look good as new.

### Usage

Open the devices menu and select your gyroscope. Ensure it reads 0 (or approximately 0), and spin the robot around a full rotation. Note the reading now displayed on the devices menu. If it is a bit less than 360, that's your number. If it is a bit more than 0, add 360 and that's your number. Input that number as the gyro scale in the drive constructor.
