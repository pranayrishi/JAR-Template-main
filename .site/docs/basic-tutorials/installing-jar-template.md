# Installing JAR Template

1. If you haven't already, download [Vexcode Pro V5](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode/pro-v5) and follow the Install Wizard's instructions to install.
2. Download JAR-Template by visiting the [latest releases page](https://github.com/2775Josh/JAR-Template/releases/latest) and clicking the "JAR-Template.zip" file.
3. Open Vexcode Pro V5 and click "File" in the top left. Choose "Import" and select the JAR-Template.zip file from earlier. 
4. VexCode will prompt you to choose a name for your new JAR-Template project. The actual name is unimportant, just enter something memorable and click "Import".

And that's it, you have installed JAR-Template on your machine.
